//Arranging different file in a particular folder for easy identification is basically the concept of packaging
//	which ever class we use use in java is inside the package
//	import java.utill.ArrayList;
//	in this java is one folder and utill is another folder in which ArrayList is present
//	Even though System.out.println System is the class in Java.Lang Package But we didn't Observe to import that in our project
//	Because in java by default for every class we create java.lang package is imported by default
//	import java.lang.*  - this was the line present
//	Access Modifiers-
